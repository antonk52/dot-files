# Solved
# - hide window bar
# - same cursor shape/color
# - alt + num shortcuts for tmux auto layouts
# - open links by clicking on them, works using `url launcher` but neither works inside vim nor tmux
#     hold `shift` to bypass apps that capture mouse clicks from [github](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/docs/features.md#opening-urls-with-the-mouse)
#
# Issues(no resolution)
# - no support for ligatures
# - `ctrl + /` beeps with no effect [issue](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3014)
#     - temporary workarount as `ctrl + minus` for toggling comments
# - no support for emoji shortcut on mac `ctrl + cmd + space`
#
# Issues(needs research)
# - focus on alacritty window by clicking it with a mouse
#   atm when clicking with a mouse focus goes to Finder instead of Alacritty,
#   not sure if Amethyst is to blame
#   though was able to reproduce with amethyst off
